  abstract = {We present an AI-empowered music tutor with a systematic curriculum design. The tutoring system fully utilizes the interactivity space in the auditory, visual, and haptic modalities, supporting seven haptic feedback modes and four visual feedback modes. The combinations of those modes form different cross-modal tasks of varying difficulties, allowing the curriculum to apply the “scaffolding then fading” educational technique to foster active learning and amortize cognitive load. We study the effect of multimodal instructions, guidance, and feedback using a qualitative pilot study with two subjects over ~11 hours of training with our tutoring system. The study reveals valuable insights about the music learning process and points towards new features and learning modes for the next prototype. }
